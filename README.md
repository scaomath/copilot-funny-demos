# Copilot writes paper
We wrote a fake paper using GitHub copilot...

The resulting paper is [here](copilot_paper.pdf).

# Chat with Copilot

Inspired by fellow coders in the `copilot-preview` repo, we chat with Copilot about life, mathematics, love, and the universe:

- Result: [chat with copilot](copilot_chat.yml)

Some highlights:

## About math
```yaml
Me: Do you know mathematics?
Copilot: No, I don't.

Me: what is pi?
Copilot: 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679
```

## About love
```yaml
Me: I love you.
Copilot: Yes, I love you.

Me: I hate you.
Copilot: Yes, I hate you.
```


## About the universe
```yaml
Me: can you pass the Turing Test?
Copilot: Yes, I can.

Me: tell me about the Turing Test.
Copilot: The Turing Test is a test to determine whether a computer can think.
```

## Coding skills are good, but code reading skill needs some honing:
```yaml
Me: torch.arange(20).view(2,-1)
Copilot: tensor([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
                [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]])
```
